Overview
========

filebrowser_safe is a permanent fork of 
`FileBrowser asset manager <http://code.google.com/p/django-filebrowser/>`_ 
for `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, to be referenced as a 
dependency for the `Mezzanine CMS for Django <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_.

At the time of filebrowser_safe's creation, FileBrowser was incorrectly 
packaged on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, and had also dropped 
compatibility with Django 1.1 -- filebrowser_safe was therefore created to 
address these specific issues.

For further details, see 
`Why are Grappelli and Filebrowser Forked? <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/frequently-asked-questions.html#grappelli-filebrowser-forks>`_.

Development
===========

You can test your local branch against the latest mezzanine development version by running `./test.sh`.
